# Keyword Platform

## Problem
Advertisers struggle generating, harvesting, translating, classifying, and
activating keywords across large Google Ads accounts at scale. Also, they come
across similar obstacles when theming ad groups based on keywords. As a result,
gPS Customer Solutions Engineers (CSE) build bespoke solutions that may rely on
internal resources which lack service level agreements even though they require
continuous maintenance. In addition, many CSE-owned Google Ads API based
solutions for keywords exist worldwide but oftentimes they are scattered or
include certain features but exclude others.

## Solution
Keyword Platform automates, open sources, and unifies the process of managing
keywords at scale via a one-stop shop that answers all keyword needs.
